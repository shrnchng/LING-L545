.SH NAME
hfst-optimized-lookup \- =Usage: hfst-optimized-lookup [OPTIONS] TRANSDUCER
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hfst-optimized-lookup
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR] \fI\,TRANSDUCER\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run a transducer on standard input (one word per line) and print analyses
NOTE: hfst\-optimized\-lookup does lookup from left to right as opposed to xfst
.IP
and foma lookup which is carried out from right to left. In order to do
lookup in a similar way as xfst and foma, invert the transducer first.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help message
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Don't be verbose (default)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Same as quiet
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-echo\fR
Echo inputs
(useful if redirecting lots of output to a file)
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-show\-weights\fR
Print final analysis weights (if any)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unique\fR
Suppress duplicate analyses
.TP
\fB\-n\fR N, \fB\-\-analyses\fR=\fI\,N\/\fR
Output no more than N analyses
(if the transducer is weighted, the N best analyses)
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-beam\fR=\fI\,B\/\fR
Output only analyses whose weight is within B from
the best analysis
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\-cutoff\fR=\fI\,S\/\fR
Limit search after having used S seconds per input
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xerox\fR
Xerox output format (default)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fast\fR
Be as fast as possible.
(with this option enabled \fB\-u\fR and \fB\-n\fR don't work and
output won't be ordered by weight).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pipe\-mode\fR[=\fI\,STREAM\/\fR]
Control input and output streams.
.PP
N must be a positive integer. B must be a non\-negative float.
S must be a non\-negative float. The default, 0.0, indicates no cutoff.
Options \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-b\fR are combined with AND, i.e. they both restrict the output.
.PP
STREAM can be { input, output, both }. If not given, defaults to {both}.
Input is read interactively line by line from the user. If you redirect input
from a file, use \fB\-\-pipe\-mode\fR=\fI\,input\/\fR. \fB\-\-pipe\-mode\fR=\fI\,output\/\fR is ignored on non\-windows
platforms.
