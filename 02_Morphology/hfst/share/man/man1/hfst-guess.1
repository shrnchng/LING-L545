[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR...] [\fI\,INFILE\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Use a guesser (and generator) to guess analyses or inflectional
paradigms of unknown words.

\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help message

\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version info

Print verbosely while processing

.SS "Input/Output options:"
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fI\,INFILE\/\fR
Read input transducer from INFILE
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\,OUTFILE\/\fR

.SS "Guesser options:"
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-model\-form\-filename\fR
Inflectional information for
generated model forms is read
from this file.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-max\-number\-of\-guesses\fR
Maximal number of analysis
per word form (5 by default).
.TP
\fB\-m\fR  \fB\-\-max\-number\-of\-forms\fR
Maximal number of generated model
forms per guess (2 by default).
.TP
\fB\-g\fR  \fB\-\-generate\-threshold\fR
Generate only forms whose weight
is better than the weight of the
of the best form plus this threshold.
(50 by default).
.PP
The guesser and generator should be constructed using the tool
hfst\-guessify, which can compile a guesser and generator from a
morphological analyzer. hfst\-guessify packages the guesser and
generator in the same fst\-file.
.PP
If option \fB\-f\fR is used, but a generator has not been compiled
with the guesser, a generator will be compiled, which will
increase load time.
.PP
If OUTFILE or INFILE is missing or \-, standard streams will be used.
